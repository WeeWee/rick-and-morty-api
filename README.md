# Rick and Morty!!

I made a Rick and Morty website using the https://rickandmortyapi.com api.
This website was made for my course "WD-JS-ext" as the final project.

## To get started

1. Start by git cloning the repo and when its cloned you need to run "npm install" or "yarn" to install the node modules.
2. Run "npm run dev" or "yarn dev".
